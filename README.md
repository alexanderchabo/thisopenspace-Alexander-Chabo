# Challenge
This test has no time limit, but for reference, candidates have traditionally done this in a couple of hours. There will be no penalty for extra time taken.

We have a JSON endpoint that displays information on spaces here https://thisopenspace.com/lhl-test?page=(x) where the (x) is a page number.

We want to have a UI where we can easily see all the listings, through pagination controls or infinite scrolling. It should not show all the spaces all at once.

The UI can be done in any form, even command-line if you are more comfortable with back-end.

You'll be evaluated on:
- Code/component organization
- Code maintainability
- If things actually work
- Library choices - do you choose libraries that you don't need?

Please submit:
- The code
- Any instructions to run it if needed
- A quick comment on how much time was taken, split between research (if needed) and implementation.
